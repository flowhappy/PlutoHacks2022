## I sincerely hope that what I have learned can help others and have a positive impact.
There are many learning resource websites now, but most of the content is outdated and messy, which brings a lot of inconvenience to people's reading. Some websites load advertisements, confusing those who are not familiar with the Internet and older people. At the same time, some excellent resource websites need to buy corresponding services to access them. There are also some resource websites, although open source, the content is simple.
Therefore, I developed a one-stop learning resource website. Times, open source, rich, everyone can publish articles...

## how it works
This is a front-end and back-end separation project. The front-end uses vue npm, and the back-end uses mysql+php.
It includes basic registration, login and other functions. It can also browse markdown documents. I like markdown very much because it is logical, simple and clear. Users can also publish articles on the website, and they can also become an open source.

## How I built it
I use scaffolding technology to quickly build front-end pages, use element-UI to beautify pages, and use PHP to develop API interfaces with front-end and back-end links and databases. Use axios to send requests and improve the efficiency of the website.

## Challenges I ran into
It is mainly the problem caused by the API interface. This is my first project to do front-end and back-end separation. Although I am very familiar with axios's request to live ajax, I still encountered some problems. For example, the problems caused by url encode and decode encountered across domains and passing parameters. But in the end, I solved it all.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
This is the first time I have participated in this kind of competition. I feel very novel and excited. I am very obsessed with this atmosphere. Although I'm not on the spot, and although I work alone, I am still very happy and motivated.
There are many more that I am proud of. For example, I wrote the front-end and back-end separation project, completed the whole stack work alone, and became familiar with many very energetic APIs... These 24 hours made me feel very fulfilling!

## What I learned
API interface development, cross-domain solutions, problems caused by URL decode and encode, how to edit, display markdown documents, etc.

## What's next for StudyHub
Next, I will continue to increase the content of the website and enrich the website. Some incentive plans may be added to make learners more immersed in StudyHub.
